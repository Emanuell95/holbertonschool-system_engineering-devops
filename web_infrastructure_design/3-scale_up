Why were these new components added?:
Additional Server - To scale the infrastructure by separating concerns and distributing load more efficiently.

Second Load Balancer (HAProxy) Clustered with the First One
To eliminate the Single Point of Failure (SPOF) in the load balancing layer.
If one HAProxy instance fails, the other can take over, ensuring high availability.

Split Components: Web Server, Application Server, Database on Their Own Servers - Why added:
To follow the principle of separation of concerns and improve: performance, scalability, security and mantainability.
